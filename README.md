# *Fitment Calculator*
## Description/Motivation

For my project I was thinking of creating a phone application that will allow people to use their cellphone to quickly calculate waht size rims and specifications they need for their cars. I'd like to give different style options too inorder to satisfy the needs of different car enthusiasts.'

### Prerequisites

What is likely to be needed to install and to run Fitment Calculator. If nothing is required (i.e. it is a website), state so.
I believe I will only need to find an application that allows me to code simple applications with camera functions.
