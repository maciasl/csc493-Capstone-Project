Fitment Calculator

Goals: My goal for this application is to have it be helpful to car enthusiast around the world. Many enthusiast today, especially the new and incoming ones today, struggle to find the exact wheel size and specifications they need to get the fitment they need. There are not many detail tutorials in order to teach people how to find this informations themselves. I want my application to not only make the proccess easier but to also inform people within the community with tricks and tips that they didn't know before.

Context: Finding the correct wheel size and specifications is not an easy task for one to do themselves or even to find quickly in the internet. I want my application to be similar to the website fitment industries but more open to casr outside the few most popular ones.

Novelty: The novelty of my solution is that anyone can use the application to find the wheels they want. It will be a simple process that even the newest of car enthusiast can use.

Functionality: I want my project ot be a simple application that will lead you through a couple steps similar ot the FIXD app.

Audience: My targeted audience are car enthusiast that will benefit from the application with time and possibly moeny becasue it will prevent mistakes in purchasing expensive products.

Challenges: The challenges that I plan on battling is the mathematical side of it. I will need to come up with an algebraic equation that will work with all models of cars.

Measures: I will know when I met requirements when I test my application on multiple cars and get the expected results.

Motivation: This application is important to me because it will solve a problem that I have battled before. I have gone through the countless hours of research to find the perfect sized wheel for my own vehicle because I didn't have the tools needed to calculate the size I needed myself. If i can make this process easier for others it will be great success for me.

Future Extensions: If time permits I would like to create another algorithm that will calculate the size you need if you have extreme negative camber that would be diificult with the original plan.
